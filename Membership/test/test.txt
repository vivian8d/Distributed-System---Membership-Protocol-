1. OPERATING SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------

Job Director, Repro Station and Machine Monitor need to be installed on a
computer running a 32-bit Microsoft Windows operating system (Windows 95,
Windows 98, Windows NT4.0, or Windows 2000).

Notes:
  * The applications can be installed and used normally on Microsoft
    Windows 2000.
  * Versions 3.4 can not be installed on Microsoft Windows 3.x.



2. FREE TEXT STAMPS AND IMAGE STAMPS IN MATRIX PROGRAMS
-------------------------------------------------------

In Job Director 3.4 and Repro Station 3.4 it is possible to add free text stamps
or image stamps to programs in matrix jobs. To select a stamp in a matrix
program, open an existing matrix ticket, or create a new one, and click "show
settings" in the matrix ticket window. Select the program(s) to which the stamp
must be added and click on the "stamp" button on the toolbar. Now the "stamp"
dialog will be displayed. When you select "on, custom", you can choose from
"printer stamp", "image stamp", and "free text stamp". All stamp settings are
the same as for stamps in normal job tickets.

Notes:
  * Detailed information about stamps is provided in the Job Director
    user manual.
  * Free text stamps and image stamps can not be printed on an Oce 9800 printer
    which is equipped with an FBBS controller.
  * When printing a matrix job which contains programs with free text stamps
    or image stamps, Repro Station automatically generates sets for this job,
    even when "repro station creates sets" is not configured.



3. GRAY SCALE VALUES FOR FREE TEXT STAMPS
-----------------------------------------

When a free text stamp is added to a file or a matrix program, the gray scale
value for the stamp can be chosen from four options: black, dark gray, gray, or
light gray. To change the gray scale value for a free text stamp, select
"edit extra settings" in the "stamp" dialog, and then choose the required value
from the "gray scale" list in the "extra settings" dialog.



4. NUMBER OF FILES DISPLAYED IN JOB TICKET WINDOW
-------------------------------------------------

The number of files in a job is now displayed in the job ticket window. A small
text box, above the list of files, shows the current number of files in the
job ticket (if the job contains at least one file).



5. ADDING TEXT OR AN IMAGE TO BANNER PAGES
------------------------------------------

Repro Station version 3.4 provides extended functionality for banner pages.
It is now possible to add "free" text or an image to the banner page which is
generated by Repro Station. These options can be configured by selecting
"Configure -> Banner page" from the Repro Station main menu. When this menu item
is selected, a dialog is displayed in which you can specify text and/or an image
that must be added to the bannerpage. Text and image options can be adjusted in
the same way as free text stamps or image stamps. (A detailed description of all
options for stamps is provided in the Job Director user manual.)

The "add text" option can be used to print banner pages containing non-ASCII
text, like European characters with accents, or Japanese characters. This was
not possible with earlier versions than Repro Station 3.4. The font for this
text can be chosen from all Windows fonts installed on your system, so this can
also be a Japanese font (if installed). Text which is added to the banner page
may contain special codes, that are filled in by Repro Station when the banner
page is printed. These codes can be chosen from the following list:
  %D% = current date,
  %T% = current time,
  %J% = jobname,
  %U% = username,
  %A% = account ID,
  %I% = job ID,
  %P% = matrix program number,
  %N% = distribution notes,
  %O% = operator notes.

The "add image" option is meant to print a company logo on the bannerpage. This
image must be of a file format recognized by the Oce 9800 and Oce 9700 printers
(e.g. TIFF, CALS, HPGL).

Notes:
  * It is not possible to add text or an image to banner pages when printing on
    an Oce 9800 printer which is equipped with an FBBS controller.
  * When "add text" or "add image" is configured, this setting applies to all
    banner pages generated by Repro Station. This setting can not be configured
    on job level.
  * This new functionality is not used to configure whether or not a banner page
    is printed. That is still configured in the job ticket or in the
    Repro Station default settings.
  * When printing a matrix job while text or an image must be added to the
    banner page, Repro Station automatically generates sets for this job, even
    when "repro station creates sets" is not configured. Sets for matrix jobs
    without banner pages, or banner pages without extra text or image, can still
    be created by the Oce 9800.
  * When Repro Station is busy rasterizing the text which is added to a banner
    page, the message "Processing..." is displayed in the statusbar.



6. SEPARATE USERNAME AND ACCOUNT ID FOR MATRIX PROGRAMS
-------------------------------------------------------

It is now possible to supply a seperate username and account ID for every
program in a matrix job. However, username and account ID are also specified on
job level. When a new matrix job is created, the initial values for username and
account ID on job level are taken from the Job Director default values. These
job level values are used as defaults for every program that is added to the
matrix job.

The user/account button in the matrix job ticket window now has two different
functions, which are explained below.

1. When the program settings are not displayed, this button opens a dialog in
which username and account ID on job level can be changed. If these job level
values are changed, the new settings will immediately be applied to all programs
in this matrix job which have these settings set to the default.

2. If the program settings are displayed, the user/account button opens the same
dialog, but now username and account ID are modified on program level for the
selected matrix program(s). Username and account ID for selected matrix programs
can also be changed by double-clicking the left mouse button on the "cells"
displaying username or account ID. If username or account ID is specified for a
matrix program (different from the job default), the specified value can only be
changed on program level, and it is not influenced when the job level settings
are changed.

The "load default settings" and "save active settings" options in the "defaults"
menu (Job Director and Repro Station) are extended, to make it possible to load
or save username and account ID which are specified on job level, or on program
level (if a matrix program is selected). In this way it is possible to store
username or account ID from one specific matrix program as default for all new
jobs, or to set username or account ID for one specific matrix program to the
Job Director or Repro Station defaults.

Notes:
  * Matrix tickets generated with earlier versions than Job Director 3.4 can not
    specify a separate username or account ID for every matrix program. If such
    a matrix ticket is opened with Job Director 3.4 or Repro Station 3.4, the
    username and account ID for the job are used for every matrix program.
  * Earlier versions than Job Director 3.4 or Repro Station 3.4 ignore settings
    for username and account ID on matrix program level. These versions only
    read the job setting for username and account ID from matrix tickets.
  * If specific users or accounts are configured in the Repro Station print
    criteria, all username and account ID which are specified for the programs
    are checked for matrix jobs.



7. REPRO STATION PRINT CRITERIA
-------------------------------

Repro Station can be configured to suspend printjobs if the required media size
or media type is not available ("print criteria" in the "configure" menu). From
version 3.4, these criteria can be selected independently of each other.

In case "media size unavailable" is selected, Repro Station will check if the
size required in the job ticket is present in the printer. This check is only
done when the job ticket specifies a specific size, and not when "auto size" is
specified. The options "wait for exact size", "use larger size", "use any size"
are taken into account when checking for available sizes. When the printer
contains a roll with the correct size, but this roll is empty, the job(s) with
this size will be suspended.

If "media type unavailable" is selected, Repro Station will suspend printjobs
that require a media type which is not currently loaded on any of the rolls in
the printer.

When both "media size unavailable" and "media type unavailable" are selected,
the message in the "analysis" field of the Repro Station queue window informs
you whether a job is suspended because the requested size, the media type, or
both are not available.

Notes:
  * When a job contains a banner page, the requested size and media type for the
    banner page are also taken into account when checking size and media type.
    Note that banner pages are always printed on paper.
  * Repro Station does not interpret the settings for (automatic) rotation when
    checking available paper sizes. For example: when a job ticket specifies an
    A1 size, Repro Station only checks if the printer contains an A1 size roll,
    even if auto-rotate to landscape is specified (in which case the printed
    drawing is cut from an A0 roll).



8. MACHINE MONITOR ACCOUNTING DATABASE
--------------------------------------

The default format for the accounting (job history) database which is created by
Machine Monitor 3.4 is Microsoft Access 97. Earlier versions of Machine Monitor
used the Microsoft Access 2.0 database format. If required, the default database
format can be changed to Microsoft Access 2.0 by an Oce service technician,
after installing or upgrading to Machine Monitor 3.4.

Every new (weekly, daily) accounting database that is automatically created by
Machine Monitor 3.4 will be in the Microsoft Access 97 database format. If you
have configured Machine Monitor to generate an accounting database with a fixed
filename, and you keep using the database which you used before version 3.4 of
Machine Monitor was installed, the format of that database will not be changed.

A detailed description of the Machine Monitor accounting functionality and of
the contents of the accounting database is provided in appendix A of the new
Machine Monitor user manual (version 3).

Note:
  * Accounting information is only available when Machine Monitor is used with
    an Oce 9700 or Oce 9800, equipped with an EPC controller.



9. OCE QUEUE MONITOR APPLICATION
--------------------------------

A new tool is provided on the Repro Station 3.4 CD-ROM. The application is
called Oce Queue Monitor, and can be used to alert the Repro Station operator
when jobs arrive in the Repro Station queue. This is especially useful when the
Oce 9800 or Oce 9700 is used for both printing and scanning. If you are at work
on a large scan job, Queue Monitor will warn you if the print queue contains
many jobs, or if jobs are waiting for a long time. At that moment you may decide
to pause your scan job for a while, so the machine will be free for printing.

Oce Queue Monitor is not installed automatically by the Repro Station setup, but
you can easily install it using the Windows Explorer. Just copy the file
"oceqm.exe" from the directory "\products\oceqm\" on the CD-ROM to a directory
of your choice on the harddisk of your PC. Now you can start Queue Monitor by
double-clicking the file "oceqm.exe". You can also create a shortcut to this
program file, and use the shortcut to start Queue Monitor.

The first time Oce Queue Monitor is run, you need to configure the Repro Station
queue directory which needs to be monitored. You can also specify the monitor
interval, the criteria for generating a message, and the appearance of the
message. When these settings are configured, Queue Monitor is running and the
Queue Monitor icon is installed in the Windows System Tray (in the right corner
of the Taskbar). When you click on this icon with the right mouse button, a
popup menu appears, from which you can change the preferences, display the
current queue status, disable or enable monitoring, show copyright info, or
close the program.

Notes:
  * When you want Oce Queue Monitor to start automatically every time you start
    your computer, you can create a shortcut to "oceqm.exe" in the "Startup"
    section of the Windows Start Menu.
  * If you leave the Queue Monitor message window open, the queue status is
    updated every time the queue is monitored.
  * You can select a Repro Station queue directory on a PC in the Windows
    Network Neighborhood if you want to monitor the queue from a remote system.
  * Oce Queue Monitor (version 1.01) is only available in the English lanuage.
  * If Queue Monitor is started from the CD-ROM, the program will not be able to
    save your settings. This means that you have to re-enter your settings every
    time you start the tool from CD-ROM.
